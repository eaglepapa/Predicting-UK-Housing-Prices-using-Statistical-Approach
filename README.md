### Project Overview
---
The main aim of the project was to design a model to predict house prices for Real Estate Agency in UK. The following equation;

**≈∂ = -2,639,000 + 21.56X‚ÇÅ + 165,900X‚ÇÇ + 121,800X‚ÇÉ + 15.24X‚ÇÖ**  

was generated for the model. It was discovered that, for every square foot increase in house size, sale price increases on average by about ¬£15.24, holding other variables constant. Also for every increase in average area income, sale price increases on average by about ¬£21.56, holding other variables constant. Average area income, house age, number of rooms, and size of the house, had statistical significant relationship with the house price.

#### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation please, I performed the following tasks:
1.	Data loading and inspection.
2.	Handling missing values.
3.	Data cleaning and formatting.
4. 	Building the model
5.	Predicting values

   
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the UK housing data to answer key business questions, such as: 
-	Does the size of a house affect the price of the house?
-	Does the average area income of the city affect the house price?
-	Does average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and size of the house, affect the house price?
-	What will be the predicted house price after inputting the values; Avg..Area.Income = ¬£540,000, House.Age = 2 years, Number.of.Rooms = 5 , and SquareFeet = 800000 sq ft, into the adopted linear regression model?

### Data Analysis 
```r
# Making predictions on the testing set (testing the model)
lm_predictions <- predict(lm_model, newdata=test_data)


# Save the trained model object to a file
saveRDS(lm_model, "lm_model.rds")

# Load the multiple linear Regression model
lm_model <- readRDS("lm_model.rds")

# Prepare the input data
input_data <- data.frame(
  Avg..Area.Income = 540000,
  House.Age = 2,
  Number.of.Rooms = 5,
  SquareFeet = 800000
)

# Make predictions
predictions <- predict(lm_model, input_data)

# Print the predictions
print(predictions) 
```

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
|NO.|BUSINESS QUESTION|ANSWER|
|------|---------------------------|------------|
|1|Does the size of a house affect the price of the house?|15.24SquareFeet means for every square foot increase in house size, sale price increases on average by about GBP 15.24, holding other variables constant.|
|2|Does the average area income of the city affect the house price?|21.56Avg..Area.Income means for every increase in average area income, sale price increases on average by about ¬£21.56, holding other variables constant.|
|3|Does average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and size of the house, affect the house price?|Y ÃÇ= -2639000 + 21.56X_1+ 165900X_2+ 121800X_3+ 15.24X_5 Means average area income, house age, number of rooms, and size of the house, has statistically significant relationship with the house price.|
|4| What will be the predicted house price after inputting the values; Avg..Area.Income = ¬£540,000, House.Age = 2 years, Number.of.Rooms = 5 , and SquareFeet = 800000 sq ft, into the adopted linear regression model?| After inputting the values; Avg..Area.Income = 540000, House.Age = 2, Number.of.Rooms = 5, and SquareFeet = 800000, into the multiple linear regression model, the predicted house price was **$22,135,164**.|

### Recommendations
After excluding variables that were not statistically significant, I recommend adopting the following linear equation for the model:

**≈∂ = -2,639,000 + 21.56X‚ÇÅ + 165,900X‚ÇÇ + 121,800X‚ÇÉ + 15.24X‚ÇÖ**

Where; X‚ÇÅ = Avg..Area.Income, X‚ÇÇ = House.Age, X‚ÇÉ = Number.of.Rooms, and X‚ÇÖ = SquareFeet


### Limitations
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and as such, the authenticity and reliability of the data cannot be fully guaranteed.
